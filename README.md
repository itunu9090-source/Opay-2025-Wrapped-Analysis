### Data Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and formatting

### Explanatory Data Analysis

- What was the available balance at the end of the year?
- What were the total credit and total debit transactions?
- Which debit method was used the most?
- What were the peak transaction periods during the year?
- On which days or periods were transactions highest?

### Results/Finding

1. The results of the user's transaction analysis are summarized below:
2. The user’s transactions increase and decrease across each quarter of the year.
3. March, August, September, and October are the months with the highest income and spending. These months account for 52% of the total transactions.
4. Mobile transactions are the most used method for both income and spending.
5. Thursday and Wednesday recorded the highest number of transactions compared to other days of the week.

### Recommendations
- The user should save more during periods of high income to avoid spending more than they earn. This will help improve financial discipline.
- The user should focus more on investing rather than spending mostly on consumption.
- Avoid keeping or transferring money frequently for other people, as transaction charges may increase expenses.

### Limitation
During the analysis, zero values in the debit and credit columns were removed because they could affect the accuracy of the results and insights.
